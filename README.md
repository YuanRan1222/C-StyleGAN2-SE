## Introduction

Day-ahead scenario generation of renewable power plays an important role in short-term power system operations due to considerable output uncertainty included. Therefore, a deep renewable scenario generation model using conditional style-based generative adversarial networks followed by a sequence encoder network (nominated as C-StyleGAN2-SE), is developed to generate day-ahead scenarios directly from historical data through different-level scenario style controlling and mixing. The integration of meteorological information serving as conditions enables the model to capture the complex diurnal pattern and seasonality difference of renewable power.
